However, Archmodels is not free. Each volume of Archmodels costs between $120 and $250, depending on the number and complexity of the models. For some 3D enthusiasts, this may be too expensive or unaffordable. That's why some people resort to cracking Archmodels, which means bypassing the security measures and obtaining the models without paying for them.
 
Cracking Archmodels is not easy, nor legal. It involves downloading the models from unauthorized sources, such as torrent sites or file-sharing platforms, and using special software or tools to unlock them.

Therefore, cracking Archmodels is not recommended or endorsed by Evermotion or any other legitimate 3D company.
